title: Building a Blog in Mintues with Jekill and GitHub
---

This is my first post on my personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages and powered by Jekyll, built in minutes using the awesome Jekyll-Now project.

For more instructions on how to setup head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
