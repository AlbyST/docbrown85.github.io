### About Me

I'm a Software Engineer from Italy, a SOLID, DRY and YAGNI believer with a no barriers interest in techs ranging from Web
Development to Embedded Linux.

### About This Blog

This blog is primarily a handbook I use to write down tech-related stuff worth to remember. Furthermore, since I learned a lot by 
browsing and reading other people's tech blogs on the net, I hope this content may give something back to the community.
